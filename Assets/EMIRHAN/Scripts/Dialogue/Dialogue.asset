  Dialogues:
  - 'Gluttony: I didn''t think you''d have the nerve to show your face, brother.
    You''re just a coward who hides in the shadows, spreading deceit from your dark
    corner.'
  - "Greed: That\u2019s an interesting perspective. But I don't expect someone as
    insatiable as you to understand me anyway."
  - ' You''re just a pitiful creature, scrambling to satisfy your stomach, your only
    knowledge is consuming and indulging. You''re far from understanding real power.'
  - 'Gluttony: Yes, real power... The one you''re trying to steal from us, isn''t
    it? '
  - Trusting you was a mistake; I never liked or thought you belonged among us.Pride's
    overconfidence brought you here; he never saw you as a threat.
  - But, Greed, it would be foolish not to see that your greed knows no bounds.
  - 'Greed: Are you still unaware of the bigger picture? All of this is Envy''s doing.'
  - 'Ah, but no, you think you have it all figured out in that small mind of yours,
    but wake up, Gluttony, your insatiable appetite, your greed, is just as dangerous
    as mine. '
  - 'And that''s what makes you Envy''s greatest enemy. '
  - 'Gluttony: You rely on yourself and your intellect, and that is your greatest
    weakness. You, who can''t do anything on your own and rely on the shadows for
    help, you''re a deceitful, cowardly creature. '
  - You'll witness your pitiful greed fade away after my power. I'll ignore your
    pleas for forgiveness just as much as you've turned a deaf ear to our vows, brother.
  - 'Greed: My ambition is boundless, your hunger is just a temporary pleasure, Gluttony.
    Today, one god''s door will close, and I assure you, it won''t be mine.'
  - 'Gluttony: Then come and stop me, Greed! Today will be your last day!'
