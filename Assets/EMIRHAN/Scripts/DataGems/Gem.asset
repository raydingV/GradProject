  Riddles:
  - Satiety? What's that, I don't know,\nMy stomach always hungers, it's a constant
    show.\nI want this, that, and everything to throw,\nSoon, everything must be
    mine, that's the vow.
  - Love, the grand deception, fools who can't see,\nTo manipulate, the highest mastery.\nI'll
    make you fall for me with glee,\nThen discard, a puppet master's decree.\n
  - Indeed, I can do it all, a bit of time you must lend,\nFirst, rest beneath this
    tree, I recommend.\nA few minutes, a few hours, or days extend,\nAfterward, to
    your side, I'll steadily wend.\n
  - Why does everyone have the best, while mine's a plight?\nWhy can't I possess
    what's yours, bathed in light?\nI want it all, loathe what's mine with all my
    might,\nLet me take your place, your life's a vision so bright.\n
  - My blood is boiling, hard to restrain,\nEveryone irks me, splitting them seems
    sane.\nDare not to face me with audacious disdain,\nThe only place you'll find
    is hell's domain.\n
  - You fools, I'm superior, that's clear,\n Dare not speak to me, stay in fear.\nFor
    now, in my realm, I'll let you be near,\nBut when the day comes, who's better,
    you'll see, my dear.\n
  - Unseen by all, yet within you I reside,\nControlling each of you, my power you
    can't hide.\nA piece of every evil, within me doth abide,\nKnow this, I'm the
    most dangerous, fear me far and wide.\n
