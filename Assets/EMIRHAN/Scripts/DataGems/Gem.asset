  Riddles:
  - Expanding like a pit, ceaselessly wide, Tries to draw everything in, a consuming
    tide.  With an insatiable appetite, it devours with pride,  What's this sin,
    that never feels satisfied ?
  - Clothless sheath, in the watchers' sights,  Untouched secret, where desire alights. 
    Veiled whispers in clandestine nights, What's this mystery where passion ignites
    ?
  - Given time by folks, yet ticks it defies,  Never aligning with the clock's cries. 
    Halting time, all matters it denies,  What's this sin, that in envy lies ?
  - Tethered to a shadow, it slithers in kind,  Stealing every light, a covetous
    mind.  As it grows, a darkness it will bind,  What's this sin, turning brilliance
    behind ?
  - Transient guest in passing guise,  Yet, the havoc left is no mere guise. Harbinger
    of storms that forever rise,  What's this sin, a dormant volcano lies ?
  - At the summit, a throne stands tall,  Strength in the heart, a skyward river's
    call.  A flaw in overconfidence, a mystery to unfold, What's the peak where this
    person's tale is told ?
  - n hands it rests, yet untouched it lays, A silent companion, in life's forays. 
    Whispers of desire, counting its sways,  What's this possession, in the shadow
    it stays ?
