  Riddles:
  - Expanding like a pit, ceaselessly wide,\nTries to draw everything in, a consuming
    tide.\nWith an insatiable appetite, it devours with pride,\nWhat's this sin,
    that never feels satisfied ?
  - Clothless sheath, in the watchers' sights,\nUntouched secret, where desire alights.\nVeiled
    whispers in clandestine nights,\nWhat's this mystery where passion ignites ?
  - Given time by folks, yet ticks it defies,\nNever aligning with the clock's cries.\nHalting
    time, all matters it denies,\nWhat's this sin, that in envy lies ?
  - Tethered to a shadow, it slithers in kind,\nStealing every light, a covetous
    mind.\nAs it grows, a darkness it will bind,\nWhat's this sin, turning brilliance
    behind ?
  - Transient guest in passing guise,\nYet, the havoc left is no mere guise.\nHarbinger
    of storms that forever rise, \nWhat's this sin, a dormant volcano lies ?
  - At the summit, a throne stands tall,\nStrength in the heart, a skyward river's
    call.\nA flaw in overconfidence, a mystery to unfold,\nWhat's the peak where
    this person's tale is told ?
  - In hands it rests, yet untouched it lays,\nA silent companion, in life's forays.\nWhispers
    of desire, counting its sways,\nWhat's this possession, in the shadow it stays
    ?
